     <h2>I have been trying poetry and here are some of my compositions.</h2>
    <p><em>(Looks like my expertise is dark humor. Hope they move you. Isn't it what poetry is all about?)</em></p>
    </br>
    <ul>        
        Do you ever get so anxious
        </br>
        That you start feeling nauseous
        </br>
        And try to be extra cautious
        </br>
        That's cuz for you ego is too precious
        </br>
        That you want everyone's behaviour towards you to be gracious
        </br>
</br> 
        I wrote u a letter using atbash cipher
        </br>
        Which u couldn’t decipher 
        </br>
        You read my name as diaper
        </br>
        Misunderstood that i got bit by a viper
        </br>
        And shot by a sniper
        </br>
</br>        
        Some relations end leaving a bitter aftertaste
        </br>
        Just because of some insult you uttered in haste
        </br>
        Polaroids of shared moments rotting in a bin, oh what a waste
        </br>
        Their memories haunt you like the beast from poltergeist 
        </br>
        You lie in bed recalling them holding you by the waist
        </br>
        And don't remember the last time you ate, not even a taste
        </br>        
        Or the last time you used a toothpaste
        </br>
</br>
</br>
        I’m so exhausted 
        </br>
        Don’t know how and when it started
        </br>
        I have a million questions in my head
        </br>
        And a billion words unsaid
        </br>
        </br>
        I used to feel like i’m the queen
        </br>
        But they said I’m not just cuz i’m not lean
        </br>
        How can they be so mean
        </br>
        Doesn’t matter, I’m still my dad’s precious little bean
        </br>
        But well, sometimes he complains that i'm a bit unclean
        </br>
</br>   
</br>
        You’ll find ur tribe
        </br>
        One that matches ur vibe
        </br>
        A bond that’s hard to describe 
        </br>
        To all worries, u then unsubscribe
        </br>
</br>
        I think i found mine
        </br>
        When we go to scrips, together we whine
        </br>
        About the tides being cold but divine
        </br>
        Their room radiates the energy of a shrine
        </br>
        And I hang out there till the end of time
        </br>
    </br>
        This poem’s a tribute to my tribe
        </br>
        Born under the same star, we jibe
        </br>
        A bond that’s hard to describe 
        </br>
        To all worries, i now unsubscribe
        </br>
    </br> 
    </br>
        I feel safe around her  
        </br>
        She was my colleague at uber
        </br>
        Wish I had known her sooner
        </br>
        But sure, late is better than never
        </br>
        Her name's Honey and she could have been a bit more sweeter
        </br>
        Just kidding, I still remember the first time I met her
        </br>
        She was hands down the sweetest person ever
        </br>
    </br>
        I don't understand how anyone can find you lame
        </br>
        For you, I would trade all my fame
        </br>
        And take all the blame
        </br>
        Without any shame
        </br>
        And still love you all the same
        </br>
        For you, I would lose every game
        </br>
        And accept all the illfate that came
        </br>
        Fight dragons that aren't tame
        </br>
        And protect you from their balls of flame
        </br>
        But you don't even know my name :(
        </br>
    </br>
        Time is ticking tictok
        </br>
        I reached a deadlock
        </br>
        And my thread doesn't want to leave the block
        </br>
        Don't you dare mock
        </br>
        I don't anymore, but there was a time when I did rock
        </br>
        My charm is currently out of stock
        </br>
        Now I am all talk
        </br>
        And I got a reject from tiktok
        </br>
        I wish to sail off, I'm right at the dock
        </br>
    </br>  
        Does poetry make you sway?
        </br>
        So much so that you lose your way?
        </br>
        Do you feel one with the rhythm? 
        </br>
        So much so that you forget what's a logarithm?
        </br>
        Do you flow with the words?
        </br>
        So much so that you identify with the birds?
        </br>
    </br> 
        Are you too enamored
        </br>
        By the twinkling stars
        </br>
        Of the night
        </br>
        To see the closest star
        </br>
        That brings the day to you?
        </br>
    </br> 
        Why are you still holding on to those shackles?
        </br>
        They are giving you nothing but lacerations
        </br>
        No, they aren't tied to your ankles
        </br>
        No, you are'nt trapped, they're all hallucinations
        </br>
        I urge you, conquer all your inner battles
        </br>
        Take a deep breath, you'll be remembered for generations
        </br>
        Tighten your fists, strengthen those knuckles
        </br>
        Zero inhibitions, fulfill all your obligations
        </br>
    </br> 
        How fragile is life?
        </br>
        All it takes is a bullet 
        </br>
        Of 8 grams
        </br>
        9 mm in length
        </br>
        To destroy it!
        </br>
        How powerful is love?
        </br>
        All it takes is acceptance
        </br>
        Unconditional
        </br>
        To transform it! 
        </br>
    </br>
        Is there a right fit for everyone? I highly doubt it
        </br>
        What if i’m the only one? Who doesn’t quite sit
        </br>
        All alone in this grand universe
        </br>
        Oh what a cruel curse!
        </br>
        I’ve been searching everywhere with grit
        </br>
        Should i just quit?
        </br>
        The stars accompany each other
        </br>
        And make the night sky lit
        </br>
        But there’s this moon, a misfit
        </br>
        All alone for better or for worse
        </br>
        Oh what a cruel curse!
        </br>
    </br>
        Why do i feel so warm thinking of you?
        </br>
        Even if a chilling gush of wind just blew
        </br>
        Waiting in a never ending queue
        </br>
        Just to get to you
        </br>
        Why do i feel so ecstatic around you?
        </br>
        Even if my assignment’s overdue
        </br>
        Maybe that’s cuz i’m in love with you
        </br>
        But you have no idea who I am, do you?
        </br>
    </br>
        I walk and I walk
        </br>
        With no destination in sight
        </br>
        Do I have anyone to talk?
        </br>
        I only see darkness, no light
        </br>
        I see my future written in chalk
        </br>
        Am I going to erase it, I might
        </br>
        I walk and I walk
        </br>
        With no destination in sight
        </br>
        Now I want to stop
        </br>
        And finally rest In peace
        </br>
    </br>
        You are my family, i said
        </br>
        But i love emily, you said
        </br>
    </br>
        All i see now is blue
        </br>
        You asked for my heart in a plate
        </br>
        You liked me? I had no clue
        </br>
        I gladly gave it, checkmate
        </br>
        I wanted to stick to you like glue
        </br>
        But it was a clickbait
        </br>
        Cuz you tore my heart into pieces
        </br>
        And filled me up with hate
        </br>
    </br>
        Should I be worried?
        </br>
        That I stopped wishing for rain
        </br>
        Even when the lilies are dying
        </br>
        Should I be worried?
        </br>
        That I lie in bed for days in vain
        </br>
        Even when the skies are crying
        </br>
        Should I be worried?
        </br>
        That I feel nothing
        </br>
        Since the day you left me
        </br>
    </ul>

    <h2>I have come up with the below quotes in an effort to help people in their journey.</h2>
    <p><em>(Hope they help you have an epiphany.)</em></p>
    </br>
    <ul>
        <li>That which is the most obvious is always the toughest to figure out.</li>
    </br>
        <li>They who transcend the notion of hero and villain, shall see me truely.</li>
    </br>
        <li>After reaching a certain stage, knowledge will only be limiting you from reaching the destination.</li>
    </br>
        <li>Let go of everything and see, only then will you capture entirety's true essence.</li>
    </br>
        <li>Weeding of mind must be performed 24/7 365 days with utmost care, and be ever watchful of the new weeds sprouting. </li>
    </br>
    <li>Blame no external stimuli for even a slight sprouting of weed in your mind.</li>
    </br>
    <li>There's no such thing as making no progress.</li>
    </ul>
